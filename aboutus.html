											<h3>What is IEEE and IEEE Computer Society?</h3>
											<p>
											The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers">IEEE</a> is the world's largest association of technical professionals with more than 400,000 members in chapters around the world. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Computer_Society">IEEE Computer Society</a> (sometimes abbreviated Computer Society or CS) is a professional society of IEEE. Its purpose and scope is to advance the theory, practice, and application of computer and information processing science and technology.
											</p>

											<h3>What is ACM?</h3>
											<p>The Association for Computing Machinery, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery">ACM</a>, was founded in 1947 as the world’s first scientific and educational computing society. Its membership is more than 100,000 as of 2011. Its headquarters are in New York City.</p>

											<h3>Our Chapter</h3>
											<p>The Munich Student Chapter was founded in 2015. The chapter is established to primarily serve the wide scope of IEEE/ACM which is advancing computing as a science and profession by supporting and training the next generation of computer scientists.</p>

											<h3>Our Vision</h3>
											<p>Our Chapter's vision is to enhance the way Computer Science is taught in our universities. We deeply believe that Software Engineering and Computer Science is a path with footsteps ahead unlike any other science. Therefore, in terms of SW Engineering, Books and Lectures only solve yesterday's problems but, here by inviting distinguished speakers from academia and industy to our lecture halls, encouraging our own students to present their hacks to the public, and providing opportunities to explore latest technologies with our Hackspace and the forefront of CS research with our Student Labs, we’re attempting to collaborate, define and solve tomorrow's problems.</p>
